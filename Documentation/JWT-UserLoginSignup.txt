Summary
The password check happens first to verify the user's identity.
Only after the password is verified is the JWT issued.
The token serves as a proof of authentication for subsequent requests; it eliminates the need for verifying the 
password repeatedly.
Subsequent Requests with JWT
Once logged in, the client sends the JWT with every request to protected routes. The server then:

Validates the JWT:
Decodes the token and verifies its signature using the secret key.
Extracts the user's ID from the payload.

Authenticates the User:
If the token is valid, the server retrieves the user's information (e.g., from the database) using the ID in the token.

This process eliminates the need to repeatedly check the password after the initial login.
