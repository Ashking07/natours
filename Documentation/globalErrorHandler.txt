How Errors Reach the Global Error Handler

In Node.js and Express.js, errors are typically propagated through the middleware stack. 
Here's a breakdown of how an error can reach the global error handler:

1. Unhandled Errors in Route Handlers:
Direct Throw: If an error is explicitly thrown within a route handler, it immediately stops the execution of that handler.
Promise Rejection: If a Promise is rejected within a route handler, the error is passed to the next middleware.
Asynchronous Errors: Errors from asynchronous operations 
(e.g., database queries, file operations) can also propagate to the next middleware.

2. Middleware Errors:
Errors that occur within middleware functions, such as custom middleware or built-in middleware like bodyParser, 
can also be thrown or rejected from Promises.

3. Uncaught Exceptions:
Any uncaught exception, whether in a route handler, middleware, or elsewhere in the application, 
can trigger the Node.js event loop's uncaughtException event. This event can be handled to gracefully 
terminate the process or log the error.

The Role of the next() Function:
The next() function is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.
If an error occurs within a middleware function, you can call next(err) to pass the error to the next middleware.
The Global Error Handler as the Last Resort:

If an error reaches the end of the middleware stack without being handled, it is passed to the global error handler.
The global error handler is typically registered as the last middleware function in the application.
Example:

JavaScript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res, next) => {
    const userId = req.params.id;

    // Simulate an error
    if (userId === 'invalid') {
        const error = new Error('Invalid user ID');
        next(error); // Pass the error to the next middleware
    }

    // ... other logic ...
});

app.use(globalErrorHandler); // Global error handler as the last middleware
In this example, if the userId is invalid, an Error object is created and passed to the next() function. 
This error will eventually reach the globalErrorHandler and be handled appropriately.

By understanding how errors propagate through the middleware stack, you can effectively design your error 
handling strategy to ensure that your application gracefully handles unexpected errors and provides informative 
error messages to the user.
