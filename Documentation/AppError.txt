Making our custom error class which extends to the original Error class,, what we are doing here is
just formatting our errors so that we don't have to repeat this all over our files.

 Benefits of Using a Custom Error Class:

 Standardized Error Handling:
 Enforces consistent error handling practices throughout the application.
 Provides a clear structure for error objects.

 Improved Error Messages:
 Allows for more informative error messages, including HTTP status codes and custom messages.

 Enhanced Debugging:
 Stack traces help pinpoint the origin of errors.
 Operational flag aids in distinguishing between recoverable and critical errors.

 Simplified Error Handling:
 Centralized error handling can reduce boilerplate code.
 Custom error objects can be easily thrown and caught.
