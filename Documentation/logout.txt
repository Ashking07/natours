This is so cool, first in index.js we are telling browser to check if there exists 
a logout button, if so then execute logout function when it is clicked, then in the 
logout function in login.js, we are sending a GET request to the api on 
route "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/users/logout", which will trigger logout function 
in authController.js from userRoute.js. Now in the authController.js in logout function we 
are basically sending an invalid cookie token with the same name as jwt so it overrides the 
original one, and sending the message as "success", now the logout function in login.js will 
receive this 'success' message and reload our window hence making the new invalid cookie in work
