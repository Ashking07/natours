When to Use APIFeatures??
The APIFeatures class is ideal for:
Basic filtering, sorting, pagination, and field selection based on req.query.
Example URL:
/api/v1/tours?page=2&sort=price&limit=5&fields=name,duration,price&difficulty=easy
This URL would result in:
Tour.find({ difficulty: 'easy' })
  .sort('price')
  .select('name duration price')
  .skip(5)
  .limit(5);

When to Use Aggregation Pipelines??
Use aggregation pipelines when:
You need statistical operations:
getTourStats calculates averages, minimums, and maximums using $avg, $min, and $max.
You need to work with arrays:
getMonthlyPlan uses $unwind to handle array fields like startDates.
You require reshaping or transforming data:
Adding computed fields ($addFields), renaming fields, or removing fields ($project).
