});

//VIRTUAL POPULATE *imp*
// This virtual field doesnâ€™t store data in the database. Instead, it creates a logical link between Tour and Review documents.
// Mongoose uses this to fetch related data dynamically during queries, without actually embedding or storing reviews within the Tour documents in MongoDB.
//By this we are populating the tours with reviews without having to do child reference them.This way we give our tours access to reviews
//We are bascically saying, what locally (In our tour model) is _id, is called 'tour' in our reviewSchema which is a foreginField. This is how we conect both
tourSchema.virtual('reviews', {
  ref: 'Review',
  foreignField: 'tour', //This is the name of the other model (Here, review model), where ref to curr model is stored.
  localField: '_id'
});
//1)First it tells to start looking at the Review model which is made out of reviewSchema.
//2) Then Here we are basically saying that, the field '_id' in reviews field here in tourModel made out of tourSchema is called 'tour' in the reviewModel,
//3)i.e the tour ids are stored as tour in the reviews. So this tells mongoose to search for all the _id's in reviews and get them.

//DOCUMENT MIDDLEWEAR: runs before the .save() and .create()
//Here, the "this" keyword points to the currently processing docs
//'this' only points to curr doc on NEW document creation, so it won't work on update method

  this.slug = slugify(this.name, { lower: true });
  next();
});

// //Below we are fetching the guides from users collection and embedding them as array in the tours documents.
